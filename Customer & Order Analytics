**Here I am querying a SQL database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

**How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_jan_sales
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE orderID IS NOT NULL
AND Length(orderID) = 6 ;

**How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_jan_sales
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE orderID IS NOT NULL
AND Length(orderID) = 6
AND product = 'iPhone';

**Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT c.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers AS c
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales AS fs
ON c.order_id = fs.orderID
WHERE orderID IS NOT NULL
AND Length(orderID) = 6;

**Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT DISTINCT Product, MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Jan
GROUP BY product, price
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1; 

**What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? 
SELECT Product, ROUND(SUM(Quantity)*price, 2) AS Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;

**Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue? 
SELECT Product, SUM(quantity) AS total_purchased,SUM(quantity)*price as Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product; 

**How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT c.acctnum), ROUND(AVG(fs.Quantity*fs.price), 2) AS Avg_Spent
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales AS fs
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers AS c
ON fs.orderID = c.order_id
WHERE fs.Quantity > 2
AND orderID IS NOT NULL
AND Length(orderID) = 6;
